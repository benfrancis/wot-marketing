# Policy for Choosing WoT-related Articles

The Web of Things Marketing Task Force collects articles about the Web of Things in their webpage at [docs/about/articles/index.html](docs/about/articles/index.html).

Currently, the Task Force only shows articles which are in one of the following categories:

- It is written by the W3C. These can be press releases
- It is written in collaboration with the Marketing Task Force where the article is reviewed by the Marketing Task Force and Interest Group before it is published.
- It is written by one of the member organizations or someone affiliated by one of the member organizations.

In the future, a more detailed policy for including third-party articles can be discussed.
