## How to use GitHub with Wikipedia

Until we find a streamlined solution, follow these steps to contribute and review the content:
* Open a Markdown file of this directory.
* This is not a real Markdown file but a copy paste of the source of the page which is in a custom format in Wikipedia.
* To view it in Wikipedia style, open any editable Wikipedia page (like [Web of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Things)), click edit source and copy paste the contents of this Markdown file.
* Then click (publish and then) preview
* You should be redirected to a page that looks like Wikipedia.
* **Please** do not publish the changes without discussing with the group through GitHub issues or weekly Web meetings
