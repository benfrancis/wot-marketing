## Email from Dominique Guinard about updating the Wikipedia for WoT (edited to fit markdown)

Good points as this page is indeed out of date. We did write parts of it (unlike the french version which was written 100%
independently) as you can guess and wrote this a long time ago. It would absolutely make sense to see it complemented with the work from the WoT WG indeed and to rewrite it.

For me I'd put the following structure in place:

### General Concept

Keep the high level description of what the Web of Things is as a general concept (more generic than the W3C WoT) by keeping [the generic WoT architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Things#/media/File:Layers_of_the_Web_of_Things_Architecture.png)

### History

In a history section acknowledge that the WoT was started as a topic and     set architectural principles by us Vlad Trifa, Erik Wilde and myself 12 years ago via the webofthings.org community (2007) and later [the first peer-reviewed paper](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Towards+the+Web+of+Things%3A+Web+Mashups+for+Embedded+Devices&btnG=) which is to date the most cited paper in this field, as well as a reference to the Building the Web of Things book as it was the first book in this field and is still used as a manual in several universities to teach IoT+WoT (and it does talk about the W3C WoT).

### W3C WoT Architecture (with TD sub-sections, etc.)

Then came all the good things that exist today, that you guys worked on and are about to be standardized. It would describe the W3C WoT work packages (TD, etc.) in greater details there.

### Early and alternative Architectures

Finally, I would put a section citing the alternative/early architectures such as:

- [The Web Thing Model](https://www.w3.org/Submission/wot-model/) which, we should explain, essentially kicked off the work at WoT W3C back then and hence the W3C WoT has a lot of commonality
- The one from Mozilla
- [The one from my PhD](https://webofthings.org/2011/12/01/phd-web-of-things-app-archi/)
- and potentially leave room for others to add theirs

### Other resources

Link resources around the WoT and let others add to that: platforms, blogs, tools, books, etc.

I do know the page requires a big rewrite and do not necessarily want to do it to make sure it is not biased. If you two work on it then I am more than happy to review and discuss.

Thoughts,

Dom
