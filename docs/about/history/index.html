	<h2>History of the Web of Things at the W3C</h2>

	<p>Web of Things has reached its place at W3C after many years of discussions and work by different parties.
	The work has started as a discussion by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/community/wot/2013/07/29/welcome-to-the-web-of-things-community-group/">
		creation of the WoT Community Group in 2013</a>. 
	It became quickly clear that there is a lot of interest in the Web of Things and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/2014/02/wot/Overview.html">
	the first W3C WoT workshop</a> was organized in Berlin, Germany	in June 2014, where more than 100 people have 
	participated and expressed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/2014/02/wot/submissions.html">
	their interests and positions</a>.
	
	Quickly after that, at the annual <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/2014/11/TPAC/"> W3C TPAC in November 2014</a>, 
	in Silicon Valley, California, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/TPAC/2014/SessionIdeas#Next_Steps_for_the_Web_of_Things"> W3C TPAC in November 2014</a> 
	It has proceed to an Interest Group in
	2015 that has collected the use cases and defined the standards to be worked on. Since 2016, the working group is
	working on different standards on the Web of Things with the first publications of the Thing Description and
	Architecture recommendations in 2019.
